# Pcap Catalog Service

A high-performance, asynchronous web service that scans directories of pcap files, catalogs them in Redis based on detailed protocol analysis, and provides a powerful REST API to search, download, and get autocomplete suggestions for protocols.

This project uses `tshark`'s native statistics engine for fast analysis, `capinfos` for total packet counts, and Redis for high-speed indexing and searching. It's designed for efficiency and ease of use, packaged with Docker for simple deployment.

## Features

- High-Performance Scanning: Uses `tshark`'s optimized statistics engine (`-z io,phs`) to analyze pcaps much faster than per-packet methods.
- Intelligent Indexing: Scans are incremental; already indexed and unchanged files are skipped.
- Detailed Metadata: Catalogs not just which protocols are present, but also the packet count for every protocol in the file and the total packet count via `capinfos`.
- Redis-Powered: All metadata and indexes are stored in Redis for extremely fast lookups.
- Asynchronous & Non-Blocking: Scanning runs in a background thread, so the API remains responsive at all times.
- Fuzzy Search / Autocomplete: Provides an API endpoint to get live suggestions for protocol names as the user types.
- Dockerized: Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for one-command setup and deployment.
- Interactive API Docs: Automatically generates Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints.

## Requirements

-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

The service, including `tshark`, `capinfos`, and all dependencies, runs inside a Docker container, so you do not need to install anything on your host machine.

## How to Run

1.  **Place PCAPs:** Place your pcap files into the `pcaps` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it:
    ```bash
    mkdir pcaps
    ```

2.  **Configure (Optional):** The service can be configured using a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy the provided example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    You can then edit the `.env` file to change the pcap directories, Redis host, etc.

3.  **Build and Run:** From the project root directory, build and run the service with a single command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4.  The service is now running. The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

An interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at [http://localhost:8000/docs] after you start the service.

You can also use `curl` for testing.

### 1. Scanning and Indexing

*(Note: An initial scan runs automatically on the first startup.)*

-   **Trigger a full re-scan of all directories:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reindex
    ```

-   **Check the status of an ongoing scan:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/scan-status | jq
    ```

-   **Backfill total packet counts for already-indexed files:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/backfill/total-packets
    ```

-   **Check the status of a backfill:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/backfill-status | jq
    ```

    *(Note: backfill is manual-only and does not run on startup.)*

### 2. Searching and Suggestions

-   **Get autocomplete suggestions (fuzzy search):**
    ```bash
    # Example: User types "ht"
    curl "http://localhost:8000/protocols/suggest?q=ht" | jq
    ```

-   **Search for pcaps containing a specific protocol (e.g., 'sip'):**
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:8000/search?protocol=sip" | jq
    ```
    
### 3. Downloading a File

-   **To download a file, you must use its SHA256 hash from the search results.**
  
    **Step 1:** Find the hash from the search results (using CLI).
    **Step 2:** Use the hash in the download URL.
    ```bash
    # Example hash found from searching for 'sip'
    FILE_HASH="a1b2c3d4e5f6..." 

    curl -o sip_capture_downloaded.pcap http://localhost:8000/pcaps/download/$FILE_HASH
    ```

### 4. Service Health

-   **Check if the service is running:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/health
    ```

### 5. Backfill search index

Trigger
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:7000/backfill/rebuild-searchindex
```

Status
```
curl http://localhost:7000/backfill/rebuild-searchindex-status
```
